<sup>
* Even though most forum features are available, note that the markdown support is currently lacking, and it might look broken sometimes. I have tried to make sure spoilers work consistently.

** Has not been tested with more than two. Please also note that AniList generally discourages the use of alts, especially for reasons such as ban evasion.
